So shau we GIF 

So the other day i coe across the blog of n00py -> Shout out to you mate :-) and read about the vuln
LDAP Null Bind. I digit deeper and try to find the same vulnerablillty on high value target. 

In my search for LDAP Null bind i used beta.shodan.io and a premium account. Pretty Quick through shodan i
could identify a number of open LDAP Server. Next i though i need proof to make sure that the
specific server is:

    1. Accessiblity ?
    2. Can view the entire LDAP Entries ?
    3. Can i identify who is the owner ?
